# Railroad Tracks

This service generates a simple railroad track map
using the _Wave Function Collapse_ algorithm as described by
[Oskar St√•lberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bcZb-SsnrA&t=350s).

For the implementation of the algorithm, we use [go-wfc](https://github.com/zfedoran/go-wfc).

## Getting started

To test the service, simple run `make run` and you should find the
result in the `output` directory.
